# NHC Operator Post-Deployment Tests

Automated tests validating the Node Health Check (NHC) operator
deployment, OLM metadata, and security posture.

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster with NHC operator installed via OLM
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access
- NHC installed in `openshift-workload-availability` namespace
- Minimum tested version: NHC v0.12.0 (RHWA 4.22 GA baseline)

## Running

```bash
ginkgo --label-filter="nhc" ./tests/nhc-operator/...
```

Or via the test runner:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
export ECO_TEST_FEATURES="nhc-operator"
make run-tests
```

## Tests

### 1. Verify NHC Resources Are Installed and Running ([OCP-89629](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-89629))

Validates that infrastructure feature annotations (disconnected, fips-compliant,
proxy-aware, etc.) match expected values, the `replaces` field references
the previous NHC version when present, and controller replicas match the
expected count on multi-node clusters. Skips replica validation on SNO.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Multi-node for replica check (skips replica validation on SNO)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected

Validates that the NHC manager container enforces a restricted security
context: runAsNonRoot at pod level, runAsUser is not UID 0 when set,
allowPrivilegeEscalation=false, capabilities.drop=ALL,
readOnlyRootFilesystem=true, and seccompProfile=RuntimeDefault (at
container or pod level). Only checks the `manager` container.

## Non-Destructive Tests -- Negative Validation and Webhook Rejection

Tests that verify NHC webhook rejection of invalid CRs and controller
behavior with misconfigured remediation templates. No node disruption --
all tests are pure API-level. NHC works with any operator that provides
a remediation template CRD; the template management test uses SNR and a
dummy TestRemediation CRD.

### Prerequisites (Negative Validation)

- NHC operator installed
- SNR operator installed (for template namespace tests)
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access

### 5. Duplicate NHC Name Rejection ([OCP-53769](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-53769))

Creates an NHC CR, then attempts to create another with the same name.
Verifies the API server rejects the duplicate with AlreadyExists error
and only one CR with that name exists.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="duplicate NHC name" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: First NHC created successfully, second NHC rejected with AlreadyExists, listing shows exactly one CR with that name

### 6. Invalid Values Rejection ([OCP-51626](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-51626))

Attempts to create NHC CRs with invalid field values: negative numbers
(minHealthy: "-30%", duration: "-30s") and arbitrary strings
(minHealthy: "string", duration: "string"). Verifies the webhook rejects
both and no CR is created.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="invalid values" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Negative-value creation rejected with spec.minHealthy and spec.unhealthyConditions errors, string-value creation rejected with same errors, CR does not exist after either attempt

### 7. Empty Selector Rejection ([OCP-61591](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-61591))

Attempts to create an NHC CR with an empty matchExpressions selector.
Verifies the webhook rejects with "Selector is mandatory" and no CR is
created.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="empty selector" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Creation rejected with "Selector is mandatory", CR does not exist

### 8. Non-Existent Remediation Template ([OCP-51625](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-51625))

Creates NHC CRs with remediation templates that do not exist: first with
a wrong template name in the SNR API group, then with a completely
non-existent API group (poison-pill). Verifies both enter Disabled phase
with RemediationTemplateNotFound reason.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="non-existent remediation template" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: NHC with wrong SNR template name reaches phase=Disabled with reason containing "RemediationTemplateNotFound"; NHC with poison-pill API group reaches same Disabled state

### 9. Missing Template Namespace ([OCP-71184](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-71184))

Tests NHC behavior when the remediationTemplate reference omits the
namespace field. Part 1: namespaced SNRT without namespace -- NHC goes
Disabled; add namespace via patch -- NHC goes Enabled; remove namespace
-- NHC returns to Disabled. Part 2: cluster-scoped TestRemediation
template without namespace -- NHC is Enabled (namespace not needed for
cluster-scoped CRDs).

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR (Part 1)
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="missing template namespace" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Part 1: NHC Disabled with RemediationTemplateNotFound when namespace missing, Enabled after namespace added, Disabled again after namespace removed with same reason; Part 2: NHC Enabled with cluster-scoped TestRemediationTemplate (TRT) and no namespace

## Non-Destructive Tests -- Template Watch

Tests that verify NHC watches remediation template lifecycle. Deleting a
template causes NHC to transition to Disabled; re-creating it causes NHC
to return to Enabled. Requires SNR operator for the SNRT template.

### 10. NHC Watches Template Deletion and Re-Creation ([OCP-71185](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-71185))

Creates an SNRT (SelfNodeRemediationTemplate) and an NHC pointing to it.
Verifies NHC is Enabled, then deletes the SNRT and verifies NHC transitions
to Disabled with RemediationTemplateNotFound. Re-creates the SNRT and
verifies NHC returns to Enabled.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="watches template deletion" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: NHC Enabled with SNRT present, NHC Disabled with RemediationTemplateNotFound after SNRT deletion, NHC Enabled again after SNRT re-creation

## Destructive Tests -- Custom Remediation Template

Tests that verify NHC triggers remediation with a custom TestRemediation
template (not SNR). Creates dummy CRDs and RBAC, stops kubelet, and
verifies the full remediation lifecycle with status field tracking.

Creates TestRemediation CRDs, RBAC, and an NHC using a TestRemediationTemplate (TRT) as the remediator.
Verifies pre-remediation status (healthyNodes=N, observedNodes=N, Enabled).
Stops kubelet, verifies during-remediation status (healthyNodes=N-1,
observedNodes=N, Remediating), confirms TestRemediation CR created. Starts
kubelet, verifies post-recovery status and TestRemediation CR cleanup.

the full remediation lifecycle: Enabled -> Remediating -> Enabled.

### Prerequisites (Status Field)

- NHC and SNR operators installed
- SSH access to worker nodes (2+ Ready workers)
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access

### 12. Status Phase and Reason Transitions ([OCP-53093](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-53093))

Creates an NHC CR for workers and verifies pre-remediation status
(phase=Enabled, reason="no ongoing remediation"). Stops kubelet via SSH
to trigger SNR remediation. Verifies during-remediation status
(phase=Remediating, reason contains "remediating"). Waits for SNR to
reboot the node. Verifies post-recovery status returns to Enabled with
original reason.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes

unhealthy. Stops kubelet to trigger remediation and validates the
healthyNodes counter drops to zero while observedNodes remains stable.

### Prerequisites (Zero Healthy Nodes)

- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access

### 13. Zero Healthy Nodes During Remediation ([OCP-56599](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-56599))

Creates an NHC CR targeting a single worker node (hostname selector,
minHealthy=0). Verifies healthyNodes=1 and observedNodes=1 before
remediation. Stops kubelet via SSH to trigger SNR remediation. Verifies
healthyNodes drops to 0 while observedNodes remains 1. Waits for SNR to
reboot the node and NHC to return to Enabled. Verifies healthyNodes and
observedNodes return to 1 after recovery.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (1+ worker), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected

## Destructive Tests -- Remediation Trigger and CR Lifecycle

Tests that stop kubelet on worker nodes and verify NHC behavior during
active remediation: selector editing, CR deletion blocking, multi-CR
coordination, and legacy CR name handling. NHC works with any operator
that provides a remediation template CRD; these tests use SNR as the
remediator.

### Prerequisites (Remediation Trigger)

- NHC and SNR operators installed (SNR is used as the remediator in these tests)
- At least 2 Ready worker nodes
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access

Edits the NHC selector to a non-existent key and verifies observed nodes
drops to 0 without crashing the NHC controller. Also verifies webhook
rejects invalid selector operator values and empty selectors.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="selector is edited" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Observed nodes drops to 0, NHC remains Enabled, invalid operator value rejected ("is not a valid"), empty selector rejected ("Selector is mandatory"), NHC state unchanged after rejected edits

### 15. NHC Editing and Deletion Blocked During Remediation ([OCP-56600](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-56600))

Stops kubelet via SSH to trigger remediation, then verifies non-selector
fields (minHealthy, unhealthyConditions) remain editable, while NHC
webhook blocks selector editing and CR deletion during active remediation.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="selector editing and deletion" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: minHealthy and unhealthyConditions edit succeeds during remediation, selector edit rejected ("selector update prohibited due to running remediation"), CR deletion rejected ("deletion prohibited due to running remediation"), NHC CR still exists and Remediating after delete attempt, SNR remediation completes, node recovers, NHC returns to Enabled

### 16. Old Default NHC CR Name ([OCP-69711](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-69711))

Creates NHC CRs with the legacy name "nhc-worker-default" and a
control-plane NHC, stops kubelet on a worker and on the control-plane
node hosting the active NHC controller, and verifies the NHC controller
fails over to another node and both remediations complete.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker and control-plane nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="old default NHC CR" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: SNR CR created for worker (NHC triggered via legacy CR), NHC controller restarts on another node (2 ready replicas), both worker and control-plane nodes recover to Ready, control-plane NHC returns to Enabled, NHC deployment remains Ready

### 17. Only One NHC CR Remediates at a Time ([OCP-66814](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-66814))

Creates two NHC CRs with different remediators (SNR at 30s, TestRemediation
at 10s), stops kubelet via SSH, and verifies only the shorter-duration
TestRemediation NHC creates a remediation CR. The SNR NHC must NOT create
an SNR CR while the node is already being remediated.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="one CR at a time" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`

### 18. Non-Remediating NHC CR Deletion During Active Remediation ([OCP-71171](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-71171))

Creates two SNR-based NHC CRs with different unhealthy durations (10s and
11s). The faster NHC triggers SNR remediation first. Verifies the slower
NHC did NOT enter Remediating, then deletes it -- the deletion must succeed.
SNR reboots the node for automatic recovery.

- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="non-remediating NHC" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Second NHC phase is not Remediating, Delete() succeeds (asserted), first NHC returns to Enabled after SNR remediation, node recovers

## Destructive Tests -- Escalation Functional E2E

Tests that verify NHC escalatingRemediations behavior end-to-end: escalation when first remediator times out, no escalation when first remediator succeeds, and escalation after SNR timeout. Uses SSH to disable kubelet persistently (survives reboot) or stop kubelet (recoverable after reboot).

### Prerequisites (Escalation E2E)

- NHC and SNR operators installed
- At least 2 Ready worker nodes
- SSH access to worker nodes
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access

### 19. Escalation from TestRemediation to SNR ([OCP-60857](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-60857))

Creates NHC with two-step escalation: TestRemediation (order=0, timeout=60s) then SNR (order=1, timeout=180s). Stops kubelet via SSH. Verifies TestRemediation CR appears first, SNR CR does not exist yet, then after TestRemediation timeout SNR CR appears (both coexist). SNR reboots the node and kubelet auto-starts, after which NHC returns to Enabled and cleans up both CRs.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="Does not escalate" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: SNR reboots the node, node becomes Ready, TestRemediation CR never created, NHC returns to Enabled

### 21. Escalation After SNR Timeout ([OCP-66806](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-66806))

Creates NHC with SNR first and TestRemediation second. Disables kubelet persistently via SSH, verifies SNR reboots the node but it remains unhealthy, and verifies NHC escalates to TestRemediation after the SNR timeout.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="Escalates after SNR timeout" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: SNR CR and TestRemediation CR coexist after escalation, kubelet re-enabled, NHC returns to Enabled, both CRs cleaned up

### 22. Escalation Order Field Validation ([OCP-60863](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-60863))

Exercises webhook validation of the `order` field in escalatingRemediations.
Rejection cases: creating NHC CRs with a missing order field and with
duplicate order values -- verifies the webhook rejects both and the CRs are
not persisted. Acceptance case: creating an NHC CR with very large order
values (9999999998 / 9999999999) -- verifies the webhook accepts it and the
CR is created.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any (no node disruption)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="order field validation" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: API returns error containing "order" for missing order and "duplicate order" for duplicate values, with the CR not created in either rejection case; NHC creation with very large order values succeeds and the CR is persisted

### 23. Escalation Timeout Field Required and Minimum Value ([OCP-60862](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-60862))

Attempts to create NHC CRs with escalatingRemediations that have a missing
timeout field and a timeout below the 60s minimum. Verifies the webhook
rejects both.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any (no node disruption)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="timeout field is required" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: API returns error containing "timeout" for missing timeout, "at least" for below-minimum timeout, CR not created in either case

### 24. Duplicate Remediator Kind Forbidden ([OCP-66838](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-66838))

Attempts to create an NHC CR with two escalation steps using the same
remediator Kind (two TestRemediation templates). Uses TestRemediation
because SNR supports multiple templates of the same Kind (via the
`multiple-templates-support` annotation). Verifies the webhook rejects
the duplicate for remediators that do not support this feature.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any (no node disruption)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="duplicate remediator kind" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: API returns error containing "same kind", CR not created

### 25. Multiple Same-Kind Templates Accepted ([OCP-74932](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-74932))

Companion to the negative case above: creates two `TestRemediationTemplate` CRs
of the same Kind that both carry the `multiple-templates-support` annotation, then
creates an NHC CR with escalating remediations referencing both. Verifies the
webhook accepts multiple templates of the same Kind when every template of that
Kind supports the feature.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+
- **Cluster**: Any (no node disruption)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:nondestructive" --focus="accepted when templates support multiple" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`

### 26. Escalation Order Change Rejected During Active Remediation ([OCP-60865](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-60865))

Creates an NHC with escalating remediations (TestRemediation then SNR),
stops kubelet on a worker to trigger remediation, waits for the
TestRemediation CR to appear, then attempts to swap the escalation order
values. Verifies the webhook rejects the update while remediation is active.

- **Operators**: NHC v0.12.0+, SNR
- **Cluster**: Multi-node (2+ workers), SSH access to worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="nhc && disruption:destructive" --focus="order change is rejected" ./tests/nhc-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: TestRemediation CR created, update rejected with error containing "escalating remediations", node recovers after kubelet restart
