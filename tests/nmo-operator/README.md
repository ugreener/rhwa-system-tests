# NMO Operator Post-Deployment Tests

Automated tests validating the Node Maintenance Operator (NMO)
deployment, OLM metadata, and security posture.

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster with NMO operator installed via OLM
- `KUBECONFIG` set with cluster-admin access
- NMO installed in `openshift-workload-availability` namespace

## Running

```bash
ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" ./tests/nmo-operator/...
```

Or via the test runner:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
export ECO_TEST_FEATURES="nmo-operator"
make run-tests
```

## Tests

### 1. Verify Node Maintenance Operator Pod Is Running ([OCP-46315](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-46315))

Validates that the NMO controller-manager pod is in Running state
with all containers ready.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology (MNO or SNO)
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="pod is running" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: At least 1 running NMO controller pod with all containers ready

### 2. Verify NMO CSV Has Required Annotations ([OCP-89626](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-89626))

Validates that the active NMO ClusterServiceVersion (in Succeeded phase)
has all required OLM infrastructure annotations with expected values.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="CSV has required annotations" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: All 8 required annotations present with correct values (disconnected, fips-compliant, proxy-aware, tls-profiles, token-auth-aws/azure/gcp, suggested-namespace)

### 3. Verify NMO Controller Manager Has Correct Number of Replicas ([OCP-89627](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-89627))

Validates that the NMO deployment has the expected replica count
and all replicas are ready. NMO runs a single replica on all
cluster topologies (MNO and SNO).

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="correct number of replicas" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: spec.replicas == 1 and status.readyReplicas == 1

### 4. Verify NMO Container Runs as Non-Root User ([OCP-89628](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-89628))

Validates that the NMO manager container enforces a restricted
security context: runAsNonRoot, no privilege escalation,
read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped, and
RuntimeDefault seccomp profile.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: Any topology
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="runs as non-root" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Pod runAsNonRoot=true; expected manager container exists; manager container runAsUser != 0; allowPrivilegeEscalation=false; readOnlyRootFilesystem=true; capabilities.drop=[ALL]; seccomp profile RuntimeDefault

### 5. Start Node Maintenance ([OCP-29592](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-29592))

Creates a NodeMaintenance CR for a schedulable worker node and validates
that the node enters maintenance mode (cordoned, Succeeded phase).

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: MNO with at least 2 schedulable worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="Start node maintenance" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: NodeMaintenance CR reaches Succeeded phase; target node is cordoned (Unschedulable=true) with medik8s.io/drain NoSchedule taint; DrainProgress=100 and PendingPods empty; BeginMaintenance and SucceedMaintenance events emitted; maintenance lease created in medik8s-leases namespace with correct LeaseDurationSeconds and HolderIdentity

### 6. Schedule Pod to Node Under Maintenance ([OCP-29603](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-29603))

Attempts to schedule a pod targeting a cordoned node and verifies it
remains Pending with no node assignment.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: MNO with at least 2 schedulable worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="Schedule pod to node under maintenance" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Pod stays in Pending phase; pod has no nodeName assigned; DrainProgress=100 and PendingPods empty

### 7. Maintenance Mode Persists After Node Reboot ([OCP-46761](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-46761))

Reboots the node under maintenance via `oc debug` and verifies that
maintenance mode (cordon + drain taint + Succeeded phase) survives the reboot.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: MNO with at least 2 schedulable worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="Maintenance mode persists" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: Node reboots (boot ID changes) and recovers to Ready; NodeMaintenance CR still exists with Succeeded phase; node remains cordoned with medik8s.io/drain taint; maintenance lease persists

### 8. Stop Node Maintenance ([OCP-29594](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-29594))

Deletes the NodeMaintenance CR and validates the node is uncordoned
and returns to schedulable state.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: MNO with at least 2 schedulable worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="Stop node maintenance" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: NodeMaintenance CR is fully deleted; target node is uncordoned (Unschedulable=false) and medik8s.io/drain taint removed; RemovedMaintenance event emitted; maintenance lease deleted

### 9. Reject a Second NodeMaintenance With a Duplicate Name ([OCP-29632](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-29632))

Creates a NodeMaintenance CR on one worker and drives it to maintenance, then
attempts to create a second CR that reuses the same name (targeting a fresh
schedulable worker -- the first node is now cordoned -- so the collision is on the
object name, not the node) and verifies the API server rejects it.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: MNO with at least 2 schedulable worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="duplicate name" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: First NodeMaintenance CR is created and reaches Succeeded phase; the second create with the same name fails with an error whose message contains `nodemaintenances.nodemaintenance.medik8s.io "node-maintenance-test" already exists`; cleanup then attempts (best-effort, logged if incomplete) to delete the CR and wait for the target node to return to Ready and uncordoned

### 10. Reject a Second NodeMaintenance for a Node Already Under Maintenance ([OCP-29630](https://polarion.engineering.redhat.com/polarion/#/project/OSE/workitem?id=OCP-29630))

Creates a NodeMaintenance CR for a worker and drives it to maintenance, then
attempts to create a second CR (different name) for the same node and verifies the
NMO validating webhook rejects it.

- **Operators**: NMO v0.17.0+
- **Cluster**: MNO with at least 2 schedulable worker nodes
- **Environment**: Connected or disconnected
- **Standalone**: `ginkgo --label-filter="operator:nmo" --focus="already under maintenance" ./tests/nmo-operator/...`
- **Pass criteria**: First NodeMaintenance CR is created and reaches Succeeded phase; the second create for the same node fails with a webhook error whose message contains `NodeMaintenance for node <node> already exists`; cleanup then attempts (best-effort, logged if incomplete) to delete both CR names and wait for the target node to return to Ready and uncordoned
